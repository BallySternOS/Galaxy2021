# Galaxy2021
Rewrite of Stern Galaxy (1980)
    
Note: This code has a dependency on BallySternOS - it won't build without those files. They're located in a repository here:
https://github.com/BallySternOS/BallySternOS
The base library is separated from this implementation so that it can be used by multiple projects without needing to be updated multiple times. For best results, always get all files (both the base library and the Galaxy2021 files) each time you build. Read on for basic instructions on how to build this code.


### To use this code
* Download the zip file (Code > Download ZIP) or clone the repository to your hard drive.  
* Get the BallySternOS files ( BallySternOS.* and SelfTestAndAudit.* ) from the repository here:  
 * https://github.com/BallySternOS/BallySternOS/tree/master
 * (Code > Download ZIP)
* Unzip the Galaxy2021 repository and name the folder that it's in as:
  * Galaxy2021  
* Copy BallySternOS.* and SelfTestAndAudit.* into the Galaxy2021 folder
* Open the Galaxy2021.ino in Arduino's IDE
* The WAV files for the Wav Trigger board can be found here:

Refer to the Wiki for instructions on how to build the hardware. 
## This project requires Rev 3 hardward with an Arduino MEGA 2560
